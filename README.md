# Pystronomical

As a keen astrophile, I am developing a website for all my fellow sky enthusiasts out there.
This files are the fundamental bricks that will compose the website UI.

It is my first real attempt to create a usable and scalable website as well as creating an entire layout with HTML and CSS.

Along with the website I will create an API for those devs interested in this kind of information, stars, constellation and observation.

The website will be completed soon, I really hope everybody will enjoy it and it could be a useful tool for seasoned astrophiles, or a first step towards astronomy for curious observer-wannabe.

Thanks,
